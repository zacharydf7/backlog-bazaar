// Backlog Bazaar release notes.
//
// HOW TO ADD A RELEASE: when you deploy a meaningful update, prepend a new entry
// to RELEASES (newest first) with a fresh, unique `id` and a few short,
// user-facing bullet points. The `id` doubles as the "seen" marker — a new top
// entry makes the "What's new" dot light up for everyone until they open the
// panel. Keep items benefit-focused; skip pure refactors/infra.
